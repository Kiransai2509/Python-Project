# Python-Project
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that involves moving disks from one rod to another following specific rules. Implementing this puzzle using a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python provides an interactive and visual approach to understanding the solution.

**Project Overview**
The Tower of Hanoi GUI application aims to visually demonstrate the process of solving the puzzle. Users can set the number of disks and see the step-by-step solution in an animated manner. The application includes controls to start, pause, and reset the simulation.

Key Features
1. User Input:

-->Allow users to specify the number of disks.

-->Options to start, pause, and reset the solution process.

2. Graphical Representation:

-->Visual representation of rods and disks.

-->Smooth animation of disks moving between rods.

3. Control Buttons:

-->Start: Begin the solution process.

-->Next: Moves to next move.

-->Previous: Moves to previous moves.

-->Done: Exits after Completion of all moves

4. Step-by-Step Solution:

-->Display each move of the disks clearly.

-->Highlight the disk being moved for better visualization.

**#Implementation Details**
1. Setup:

-->Use the Tkinter library for creating the GUI.

-->Create a window with areas for the rods and disks.

2. User Interface:

-->Input fields for specifying the number of disks.

-->Buttons for Start, Next, Previous and Done functionalities.

-->Display area for the rods and disks.

3. Algorithm:

-->Implement the recursive Tower of Hanoi algorithm to determine the sequence of moves.

-->Use Next and Previous to control the animation of the disk movements.

4. Graphics and Animation:

-->Use shapes (e.g., rectangles) to represent the disks.

-->Animate the movement of the disks between rods.
